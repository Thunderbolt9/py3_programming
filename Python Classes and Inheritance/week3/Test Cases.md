### The function mySum is supposed to return the sum of a list of numbers (and 0 if that list is empty), but it has one or more errors in it. Use this space to write test cases to determine what errors there are. You will be using this information to answer the next set of multiple choice questions.
```python
import test


def mySum(list):
    if len(list) > 0:
        res = 0
        for i in list:
            res += i
        return res
    else:
        return 0

```
### Which of the following cases fail for the mySum function?

### Are there any other cases, that we can determine based on the current structure of the function, that also fail for the mySum function?
